# Claude UI

Claude UI is a desktop app that brings Claude Code into a clean multi-session workspace.

## What You Can Do

- Work across multiple Claude sessions in one app.
- Organize sessions by project in a focused sidebar.
- Start sessions with an initial prompt, chosen model, and permission mode.
- Set project defaults so new sessions start with your preferred settings.
- See clear live status indicators:
  - running
  - working
  - awaiting approval
  - awaiting user response
  - stopped / error
- Stop, resume, switch, and delete sessions quickly.
- Keep history available when switching between sessions.
- Auto-generate session titles for unnamed conversations.
- View Claude usage metrics from the built-in usage panel.
- Reopen the app and continue from saved projects and sessions.

## Feature Highlights
